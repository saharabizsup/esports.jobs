# Agile Process for Esports.Jobs

## Backlog Management
- **Tooling**: Adopt [Linear](https://linear.app/) for product and engineering backlog management. Configure the workspace with the following project hierarchy:
  - *Teams*: Product, Engineering, Design.
  - *Projects*: Organized by major product initiatives (e.g., "Talent Marketplace", "Employer Experience").
  - *Cycles*: Two-week sprints aligned with product roadmaps.
- **Issue Intake**:
  - All feature requests, bugs, and operational tasks are captured in Linear using standardized templates.
  - Incoming work is triaged during a twice-weekly backlog grooming session by the Product Manager (PM) and Tech Lead (TL).
  - Requests from customer-facing teams are submitted through a shared Linear form that automatically labels them by source and urgency.
- **Prioritization Framework**:
  - Use the RICE scoring model (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) during grooming to prioritize new items.
  - Maintain a clearly ordered backlog that reflects the next two sprints of committed work plus a parking lot of future opportunities.

## Sprint Rituals
- **Sprint Cadence**: Two-week iterations running Monday–Friday.
- **Rituals**:
  - *Sprint Planning (2 hrs, Day 1)*: PM presents prioritized backlog, Engineering estimates remaining items, team aligns on sprint goal and commitments.
  - *Daily Standup (15 mins, Mon–Thu)*: Share progress, blockers, and planned work for the day.
  - *Backlog Refinement (1 hr, Mid-Sprint)*: Review upcoming backlog, clarify requirements, update estimates, and reprioritize as needed.
  - *Sprint Review (1 hr, Final Thursday)*: Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders, capture feedback for the next cycle.
  - *Sprint Retrospective (1 hr, Final Friday)*: Discuss what went well, what can improve, and actionable experiments for the following sprint.
- **Cross-Team Visibility**:
  - Publish sprint goals and committed stories in the #product Slack channel at the start of each cycle.
  - Maintain a shared sprint dashboard in Linear summarizing burndown, scope changes, and key learnings.

## Discovery & Feedback Sessions
- Schedule bi-weekly (every other Wednesday) 45-minute discovery calls with rotating sets of target users: esports organizations, talent seeking opportunities, and hiring managers.
- Maintain a roster of advisor sessions once per month focused on strategic feedback and roadmap alignment.
- Capture all discovery notes in a shared Notion workspace, tagging insights with relevant Linear issues for traceability.
